// You can write SCSS here! Including these SCSS-style double-slash comment, which would NOT be
// valid in CSS.
// To use SCSS, just keep the two lines of triple dashes above, and add them to the very top of any
// other .scss file you might create.

// First, import the reset-styles partial:
@import "reset";

// Other styles or partial imports go here...
// Keep your partials in the `_scss/` directory, and name them with an opening underscore, e.g.,
// `_colors.scss`, which you'd then be able to import with `@import "colors";`

// Never written SCSS before? Have a look at https://sass-lang.com/guide
